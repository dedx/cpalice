    "There are many areas of physics where it is useful to simulate a phenomenon before we conduct an experiment, to help guide the experimental design and procedure.  There are also cases where we use simulations of an experiment after the fact to correct for any instrumental biases.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in high energy particle and nuclear collisions, we need to know how well our detectors \"see\" the particles produced in the collisions so we can optimize their design to catch as many as possible.  We can use Monte Carlo sampling to simulate the stochastic nature of the interaction of particles with matter to model the \"response\" of our detector to particles of a known type and energy.  The input to the simulation represents the \"true\" distribution of particles, while the output corresponds to an estimate of the \"observed\" distribution of particles, assuming that we have accurately characterized the physics of the interactions in our simulation.  The ratio of input to output can be used as a correction factor to estimate the \"true\" distribution of particles from the \"observed\" distribution in a real experiment.  Obviously, reliable simulations are essential to producing good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [GEANT4](http://www.geant4.org/geant4/) package, written in C++, and its Fortran 77 precursor GEANT3, are toolkits for simulating the passage of particles through matter.  The simulations use Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the inherently stochastic processes that govern particle interactions.  All of the LHC experiments and many other high energy particle and nuclear physics experiments rely on it.  The physics in the package has been tested repeatedly against benchmark experimental data to validate its output.  It is a complex program that can be daunting when you first start using it, so many concrete examples are provided with the software to show how it can be used in different contexts.  Assessing radiation damage and the interaction of particle beams with human tissue for medical applications are two notable examples.  \n",
